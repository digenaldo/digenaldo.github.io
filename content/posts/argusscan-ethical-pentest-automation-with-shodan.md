# ArgusScan: Automating Ethical Pentest with Shodan API

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/digenaldo/argusscan

## Introduction

Security professionals know that reconnaissance is one of the most important steps in a penetration test. Finding vulnerable systems, understanding network exposure, and identifying potential attack surfaces takes time and requires using multiple tools.

What if you could automate this process while maintaining professional standards and generating reports that follow industry methodologies like PTES and OWASP?

That's where ArgusScan comes in. It's an open-source Python CLI tool that integrates with Shodan API to automate ethical pentest reconnaissance, making security assessments faster and more efficient.

## What is ArgusScan?

ArgusScan is a professional pentest automation tool that uses Shodan API to search for vulnerable hosts and exposed services. It's designed for security professionals who need to perform authorized security assessments quickly and generate professional reports.

The tool is built with Python 3.8+ and provides a rich command-line interface that makes it easy to search for specific services, filter results, and export data in multiple formats.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Professional CLI with colorful output using the Rich library
- Multiple export formats: Markdown, JSON, CSV
- Advanced filtering options
- Professional report generation following PTES/OWASP standards
- Rate limiting to respect API limits
- Integration with popular security tools

## Key Features

### Shodan API Integration

ArgusScan fully integrates with Shodan API, allowing you to search for vulnerable hosts using Shodan search queries (also known as "dorks"). You can search by service, port, country, organization, and many other criteria.

The tool handles API authentication, rate limiting, and error handling automatically, so you can focus on your security assessment.

### Professional CLI Interface

The command-line interface uses the Rich library to provide colorful, organized output. This makes it easy to read results and understand what the tool is doing. The interface shows progress, results, and any errors clearly.

### Multiple Export Formats

ArgusScan supports three export formats:

- **Markdown**: Perfect for documentation and reports
- **JSON**: Ideal for integration with other tools and automation
- **CSV**: Great for spreadsheet analysis and data processing

This flexibility allows you to use ArgusScan results in different workflows and integrate them with other security tools.

### Advanced Filtering

You can filter Shodan results by:
- Country code (e.g., `country:BR` for Brazil)
- Port number (e.g., `port:8080`)
- Organization name
- And many other Shodan search parameters

This helps you narrow down results to specific targets or regions, making your assessment more focused and efficient.

### Professional Reports

ArgusScan generates reports that follow industry standards like PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard) and OWASP methodologies. These reports are suitable for professional pentest engagements and can be included in your final deliverables.

### Rate Limiting

The tool respects Shodan API rate limits (1 request per second) automatically. This prevents API errors and ensures you stay within your plan's limits, whether you're using a free or paid Shodan account.

### Tool Integration

ArgusScan is designed to work with popular security tools:
- **Nuclei**: Use results to run vulnerability scans
- **OWASP ZAP**: Import targets for automated security testing
- **Metasploit**: Use discovered services as targets for exploitation

The JSON export format makes it easy to integrate with these and other tools.

## Installation and Setup

Installing ArgusScan is straightforward:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/digenaldo/argusscan.git
cd argusscan

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the tool
python argus_scan.py --help
```

You'll need a Shodan API key, which you can get from [Shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/). Free accounts have some limitations, but they work with ArgusScan for basic searches.

## Usage Examples

Here are practical examples of how to use ArgusScan:

### Search for Jenkins Instances

```bash
python argus_scan.py "jenkins port:8080" --token YOUR_API_KEY
```

This searches for Jenkins instances running on port 8080. Jenkins is often misconfigured and can be a security risk if exposed publicly.

### Search Apache Servers in Brazil

```bash
python argus_scan.py "apache country:BR" --token YOUR_API_KEY
```

This finds Apache web servers located in Brazil. You can use country filters to focus on specific regions.

### Export Results to JSON

```bash
python argus_scan.py "jenkins" --token YOUR_API_KEY --export json
```

This exports results in JSON format, which you can use with other tools or scripts for further analysis.

### Generate Professional Report

```bash
python argus_scan.py "apache" --token YOUR_API_KEY --export markdown --report
```

This generates a professional markdown report following PTES/OWASP standards, suitable for client deliverables.

## Technical Excellence

ArgusScan is built with quality in mind:

**Comprehensive Testing:**
- 25 unit tests covering all major functionality
- 96% code coverage ensuring reliability
- Automated testing with GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

**Code Quality:**
- Pre-commit hooks for quality assurance
- Modern Python 3.8+ implementation
- Clean, maintainable code structure

**Professional Development Practices:**
- Version control with Git
- Issue tracking and pull request workflow
- Documentation and examples

This level of quality ensures the tool is reliable and suitable for professional use.

## Integration with Pentest Workflows

ArgusScan fits naturally into professional pentest workflows:

**Reconnaissance Phase:**
Use ArgusScan to identify exposed services and potential targets before starting detailed testing.

**Tool Integration:**
Export results to JSON and import them into Nuclei, OWASP ZAP, or Metasploit for automated vulnerability scanning and exploitation.

**Reporting:**
Generate professional reports that can be included in your final pentest deliverables, following PTES and OWASP standards.

**Documentation:**
Use Markdown exports to document findings and create detailed reports for clients.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

**This is extremely important:** ArgusScan should only be used with proper authorization.

**Mandatory Requirements:**
- Written authorization (Rules of Engagement - RoE) before any scanning
- Only scan systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations

**Authorized Use Cases:**
- Bug bounty programs with written authorization
- Professional pentest engagements with signed RoE
- Academic security research with proper approvals
- Defensive security assessments of your own infrastructure
- Red team exercises with proper authorization

**Unauthorized Use:**
- Never scan systems without permission
- Never use for malicious purposes
- Never violate terms of service
- Never break laws or regulations

Security tools are powerful, and with that power comes responsibility. Always use ArgusScan ethically and legally.

## Use Cases

ArgusScan is useful in several scenarios:

**Authorized Bug Bounty Programs:**
When you have written authorization to test specific targets, ArgusScan helps you find exposed services quickly.

**Professional Pentest Engagements:**
Use it during the reconnaissance phase to identify potential targets and attack surfaces before detailed testing.

**Academic Security Research:**
Researchers can use it to study internet exposure and security trends, always with proper authorization.

**Defensive Security Assessments:**
Organizations can use it to assess their own infrastructure and identify misconfigurations or exposed services.

**Red Team Exercises:**
Red teams can use it to find targets within authorized scope during exercises.

## Future Roadmap

The project is actively maintained, and future enhancements may include:

- Support for additional export formats
- Integration with more security tools
- Enhanced filtering options
- Web interface for easier use
- Additional report templates
- Performance improvements
