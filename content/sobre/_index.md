I'm **Digenaldo Neto**, a software engineer with more than **10 years of experience** in development and distributed systems architecture.  

I have a degree in **Information Systems from UFPB** and a **Master's in Information Technology from IFPB**. I did research on **DDoS attack detection at the application layer** using **machine learning and Big Data**.

I work on building **scalable, secure, and high-performance applications**, focusing on **modern software engineering, cloud infrastructure, and system resilience**.  

In recent years, I've focused my career on **information security engineering**, exploring practices for **web application protection** and **access control in distributed environments**.

**Why I'm here**

I created this space to **share knowledge in a practical and direct way** without unnecessary complexity.  

My goal is to **help both people who are starting in technology**, offering clear paths and solid fundamentals, **and professionals who already work in the field and want to grow**, with topics about **architecture, security, and application performance**.

If you're looking for clarity, purpose, and continuous learning in technology, you're in the right place.
