When you can see what your systems are doing, you can make better decisions about performance, resource usage, and reliability.\nI built a Monitoring Lab to compare how Go and Spring Boot applications perform under similar conditions. Both applications connect to MongoDB and perform the same operations, while Prometheus collects metrics and Grafana visualizes the results.\nThis article focuses on the actual results and what the metrics tell us about the performance differences between these two technologies.\nThe Setup The Monitoring Lab includes two backend applications running the same workload:\nA Go application that performs MongoDB operations every 5 seconds A Spring Boot application performing the same operations at the same interval Prometheus collecting metrics from both applications Grafana dashboards showing real-time performance data Both applications execute similar operations: they ping MongoDB, insert documents, and record metrics about their performance. The key difference is the technology stack each one uses.\nPerformance Metrics Analysis Go Application Performance The Go application shows consistent and efficient performance across all metrics:\nCPU Usage: The Go app maintains very low CPU usage at around 0.22%. This shows the application is lightweight and doesn’t require much processing power for these operations.\nMemory Usage: Memory consumption stays stable at approximately 21.6 MiB. This is a small amount of memory, showing that Go applications can be very memory-efficient.\nMongoDB Latency: The latency metrics show excellent performance:\nAverage latency stays between 0.5 ms and 1.2 ms P95 latency (95th percentile) remains consistently around 4.5 ms P99 latency (99th percentile) stays around 5 ms These numbers mean that most operations complete very quickly, and even the slowest operations are still fast.\nOperations Rate: The application maintains a steady rate of 0.3 operations per second, which matches the expected interval of one operation every 5 seconds.\nSpring Boot Application Performance The Spring Boot application shows different characteristics:\nCPU Usage: Similar to Go, CPU usage is low at around 0.28%. Both applications handle the workload without stressing the CPU.\nMemory Usage: This is where we see a significant difference. The Spring Boot application uses 112 MiB of memory, which is more than 5 times the memory used by the Go application. This higher memory usage is typical for Java applications due to the JVM overhead.\nMongoDB Latency: The latency metrics show more variation:\nAverage latency fluctuates between 10 ms and 15 ms P95 latency follows similar patterns to the average P99 latency ranges from 15 ms to 25 ms, with spikes reaching nearly 30 ms The latency is consistently higher than the Go application, which suggests the Spring Boot application takes longer to complete the same operations.\nOperations Rate: The application maintains 0.4 operations per second, slightly higher than the Go application.\nJVM Heap Memory: The dashboard shows how the Java Virtual Machine manages memory:\nG1 Eden Space fills up and gets cleared during garbage collection cycles G1 Old Gen gradually increases over time as objects are promoted G1 Survivor Space remains minimal This memory management pattern is normal for Java applications but adds overhead that Go applications don’t have.\nDirect Comparison The comparison dashboard makes the differences clear:\nLatency Comparison:\nGo maintains average latency below 2.5 ms throughout the entire period Spring Boot shows average latency ranging from 6 ms to 15 ms Go’s latency is consistently 3 to 6 times lower than Spring Boot’s Memory Comparison:\nGo uses between 16 MiB and 24 MiB consistently Spring Boot starts at 112 MiB and fluctuates between 80 MiB and 104 MiB Spring Boot uses approximately 4 to 7 times more memory than Go These results show that for this specific workload, the Go application performs better in terms of both latency and memory usage.\nKey Metrics Explained Understanding these metrics helps you make informed decisions about which technology to use:\nCPU Usage: Shows how much processing power the application needs. Lower is better, as it leaves more resources for other processes.\nMemory Usage: Indicates how much RAM the application consumes. Lower memory usage means you can run more instances on the same server.\nAverage Latency: The typical time it takes for an operation to complete. Lower latency means faster responses to users.\nP95 and P99 Latency: These percentiles show how the slowest operations perform. P95 means 95% of operations are faster than this value. P99 means 99% of operations are faster. These metrics help you understand worst-case performance.\nOperations Rate: How many operations the application completes per second. This helps you understand throughput.\nWhat These Results Mean The metrics show clear patterns:\nGo excels at low latency: The Go application consistently completes operations faster, with latency staying under 2.5 ms.\nGo uses less memory: With memory usage around 21 MiB, Go applications can run more instances on the same hardware.\nSpring Boot has higher overhead: The JVM and framework layers add overhead, resulting in higher latency and memory usage.\nBoth handle the workload: Neither application struggles with the workload, showing that both technologies can handle this type of operation effectively.\nIt’s important to remember that these results are specific to this test scenario. Different workloads, different operations, or different configurations might produce different results.\nReal-World Implications These metrics matter in production environments:\nLower latency means users get faster responses, which improves user experience. For applications handling many requests, even small latency differences can add up significantly.\nLower memory usage means you can run more application instances on the same server, which can reduce infrastructure costs. It also means applications start faster and use fewer resources.\nConsistent performance is important for reliability. When latency varies widely, it’s harder to predict how the application will behave under load.\nConclusion The Monitoring Lab provides real data about how Go and Spring Boot applications perform. The results show that for this specific workload:\nGo offers better latency performance and lower memory usage Spring Boot provides easier development through frameworks and tools, but with higher resource usage Both technologies can handle the workload effectively The choice between technologies depends on your specific needs. If low latency and low memory usage are priorities, Go might be a better fit. If rapid development and a rich ecosystem are more important, Spring Boot might be the right choice.\nObservability tools like Prometheus and Grafana make it possible to see these differences clearly. Without metrics, you’re making decisions based on assumptions. With metrics, you can make decisions based on data.\nThe code and dashboards are available on GitHub: https://github.com/digenaldo/monitoring-lab\n","wordCount":"1091","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-12-12T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-12-12T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Digenaldo Neto"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://digenaldo.com/posts/monitoring-lab-complete-observability-with-go-spring-boot-prometheus/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://digenaldo.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
