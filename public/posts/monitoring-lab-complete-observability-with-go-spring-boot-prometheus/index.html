Having visibility into how your systems behave, perform, and stay healthy is essential to make sure they are reliable and you can respond quickly to problems.\nIn this article, I will share how I created a complete Monitoring Lab - an observability lab that compares performance between Go and Spring Boot applications, collecting metrics through Prometheus and visualizing everything in Grafana.\nWhat is the Monitoring Lab? The Monitoring Lab is a complete observability project that includes:\nTwo backend applications (Go and Spring Boot) that run operations on MongoDB Prometheus for collecting and storing metrics Grafana for visualization and dashboards Exporters for MongoDB and system metrics Everything organized with Docker Compose The goal is to create a realistic environment where we can observe and compare performance between different technologies, understand how to implement custom metrics, and learn about the observability ecosystem.\nProject Architecture The architecture is simple but complete:\nThe Go App (Port 8080) and Spring App (Port 8081) connect to MongoDB (Port 27017). Prometheus (Port 9090) collects metrics from both applications, plus the MongoDB Exporter and Node Exporter. Grafana (Port 3001) uses the metrics from Prometheus for visualization.\nApplication Implementation Go Application The Go application was built with a focus on simplicity and performance. It uses:\nOfficial MongoDB Driver for Go Prometheus Client Library to expose metrics Goroutines for asynchronous operations The application runs an infinite loop that, every 5 seconds:\nPings MongoDB Inserts a document into the events collection Records latency metrics and counters Metrics are exposed at the /metrics endpoint in Prometheus format.\nSpring Boot Application The Spring Boot application uses:\nSpring Data MongoDB for database access Micrometer for metrics (natively integrated with Spring Boot) @Scheduled for periodic tasks Similar to the Go application, it runs operations every 5 seconds:\nCounts documents in the events collection Inserts a new document Records metrics through Micrometer Metrics are automatically exposed at the /actuator/prometheus endpoint.\nPrometheus Configuration Prometheus is configured to collect metrics from multiple sources:\nGo App (/metrics) Spring App (/actuator/prometheus) MongoDB Exporter (database metrics) Node Exporter (operating system metrics) The scrape interval is set to 5 seconds, allowing near real-time visualization of metrics.\nGrafana Dashboards One of the most interesting parts of the project is the pre-configured comparative dashboard. It shows:\nGo application metrics: CPU, memory, MongoDB operation latency Spring Boot application metrics: CPU, memory, MongoDB operation latency Side-by-side comparisons: allowing you to see performance differences between the two technologies The dashboard is automatically set up through JSON files, so you don’t need to configure it manually after starting the containers.\nCustom Metrics Both applications expose relevant custom metrics:\nGo App:\nmongodb_operations_total - Total operations performed mongodb_operation_duration_seconds - Latency histogram Spring App:\nmongodb_total_operations - Total operations mongodb_count_velocity - Count operation velocity mongodb_operation_latency_seconds - Operation latency These metrics help you understand not just if the applications are working, but also how they are performing.\nDocker Compose and Orchestration The entire environment is organized through a single docker-compose.yml file. This makes it easy to:\nStart quickly: podman compose up -d --build Isolate services: each service in its own container Share network: communication between services Persistent volumes: MongoDB and Grafana data are kept An important decision was to remove the service_healthy conditions from dependencies, as they were causing freezes in podman compose. The services still have health checks, but they don’t block other services from starting.\nChallenges and Solutions During development, I found some challenges:\nPort conflict: Grafana was configured for port 3000, which was already in use. Solution: change to port 3001.\nFreezes in podman compose: The service_healthy conditions were causing indefinite waits. Solution: remove these conditions and rely only on basic dependencies.\nDifferent metrics between Go and Spring: Each technology exposes metrics differently. Solution: create specific Prometheus queries for each application in the dashboard.\nResults and Insights The project allows you to observe some interesting differences:\nGo: Generally shows lower memory usage and more consistent latency Spring Boot: Makes implementation easier through Spring Actuator, but may have higher overhead It’s important to note that these observations are specific to this test scenario and should not be generalized without more comprehensive tests.\nHow to Use The project is available on GitHub and can be run easily:\ngit clone https://github.com/digenaldo/monitoring-lab cd monitoring-lab podman compose up -d --build After a few seconds, all services will be available:\nGo App: http://localhost:8080 Spring App: http://localhost:8081 Prometheus: http://localhost:9090 Grafana: http://localhost:3001 (user: admin, password: admin) Conclusion This Monitoring Lab serves as an excellent starting point to understand observability in practice. It demonstrates:\nHow to implement custom metrics in different technologies How to configure a complete observability stack How to visualize and compare metrics from different applications The importance of having visibility into system behavior Observability is not just about collecting data, but about turning that data into actionable insights. With Prometheus and Grafana, we have the tools we need for that.\nNext Steps Some improvements that can be implemented:\nAdd alerts in Prometheus Configure alerts in Grafana Implement more custom metrics (business metrics) Add distributed tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin) Implement more robust health checks The code is available on GitHub and contributions are welcome!\n","wordCount":"874","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-12-12T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-12-12T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Digenaldo Neto"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://digenaldo.com/posts/monitoring-lab-complete-observability-with-go-spring-boot-prometheus/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://digenaldo.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
