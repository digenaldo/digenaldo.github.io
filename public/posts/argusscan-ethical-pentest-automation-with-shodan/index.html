Finding vulnerable systems, understanding network exposure, and identifying potential attack surfaces takes time and requires using multiple tools.\nWhat if you could automate this process while maintaining professional standards and generating reports that follow industry methodologies like PTES and OWASP?\nThat’s where ArgusScan comes in. It’s an open-source Python CLI tool that integrates with Shodan API to automate ethical pentest reconnaissance, making security assessments faster and more efficient.\nWhat is ArgusScan? ArgusScan is a professional pentest automation tool that uses Shodan API to search for vulnerable hosts and exposed services. It’s designed for security professionals who need to perform authorized security assessments quickly and generate professional reports.\nThe tool is built with Python 3.8+ and provides a rich command-line interface that makes it easy to search for specific services, filter results, and export data in multiple formats.\nKey Characteristics:\nProfessional CLI with colorful output using the Rich library Multiple export formats: Markdown, JSON, CSV Advanced filtering options Professional report generation following PTES/OWASP standards Rate limiting to respect API limits Integration with popular security tools Key Features Shodan API Integration ArgusScan fully integrates with Shodan API, allowing you to search for vulnerable hosts using Shodan search queries (also known as “dorks”). You can search by service, port, country, organization, and many other criteria.\nThe tool handles API authentication, rate limiting, and error handling automatically, so you can focus on your security assessment.\nProfessional CLI Interface The command-line interface uses the Rich library to provide colorful, organized output. This makes it easy to read results and understand what the tool is doing. The interface shows progress, results, and any errors clearly.\nMultiple Export Formats ArgusScan supports three export formats:\nMarkdown: Perfect for documentation and reports JSON: Ideal for integration with other tools and automation CSV: Great for spreadsheet analysis and data processing This flexibility allows you to use ArgusScan results in different workflows and integrate them with other security tools.\nAdvanced Filtering You can filter Shodan results by:\nCountry code (e.g., country:BR for Brazil) Port number (e.g., port:8080) Organization name And many other Shodan search parameters This helps you narrow down results to specific targets or regions, making your assessment more focused and efficient.\nProfessional Reports ArgusScan generates reports that follow industry standards like PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard) and OWASP methodologies. These reports are suitable for professional pentest engagements and can be included in your final deliverables.\nRate Limiting The tool respects Shodan API rate limits (1 request per second) automatically. This prevents API errors and ensures you stay within your plan’s limits, whether you’re using a free or paid Shodan account.\nTool Integration ArgusScan is designed to work with popular security tools:\nNuclei: Use results to run vulnerability scans OWASP ZAP: Import targets for automated security testing Metasploit: Use discovered services as targets for exploitation The JSON export format makes it easy to integrate with these and other tools.\nInstallation and Setup Installing ArgusScan is straightforward:\n# Clone the repository git clone https://github.com/digenaldo/argusscan.git cd argusscan # Install dependencies pip install -r requirements.txt # Run the tool python argus_scan.py --help You’ll need a Shodan API key, which you can get from Shodan.io. Free accounts have some limitations, but they work with ArgusScan for basic searches.\nUsage Examples Here are practical examples of how to use ArgusScan:\nSearch for Jenkins Instances python argus_scan.py \"jenkins port:8080\" --token YOUR_API_KEY This searches for Jenkins instances running on port 8080. Jenkins is often misconfigured and can be a security risk if exposed publicly.\nThe output shows detailed information about discovered hosts, including IP addresses, ports, organizations, products, and identified vulnerabilities (CVEs). This makes it easy to identify potential targets and understand their security posture.\nSearch Apache Servers in Brazil python argus_scan.py \"apache country:BR\" --token YOUR_API_KEY This finds Apache web servers located in Brazil. You can use country filters to focus on specific regions.\nExport Results to JSON python argus_scan.py \"jenkins\" --token YOUR_API_KEY --export json This exports results in JSON format, which you can use with other tools or scripts for further analysis.\nGenerate Professional Report python argus_scan.py \"apache\" --token YOUR_API_KEY --export markdown --report This generates a professional markdown report following PTES/OWASP standards, suitable for client deliverables.\nTechnical Excellence ArgusScan is built with quality in mind:\nComprehensive Testing:\n25 unit tests covering all major functionality 96% code coverage ensuring reliability Automated testing with GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline Code Quality:\nPre-commit hooks for quality assurance Modern Python 3.8+ implementation Clean, maintainable code structure Professional Development Practices:\nVersion control with Git Issue tracking and pull request workflow Documentation and examples This level of quality ensures the tool is reliable and suitable for professional use.\nIntegration with Pentest Workflows ArgusScan fits naturally into professional pentest workflows:\nReconnaissance Phase: Use ArgusScan to identify exposed services and potential targets before starting detailed testing.\nTool Integration: Export results to JSON and import them into Nuclei, OWASP ZAP, or Metasploit for automated vulnerability scanning and exploitation.\nReporting: Generate professional reports that can be included in your final pentest deliverables, following PTES and OWASP standards.\nDocumentation: Use Markdown exports to document findings and create detailed reports for clients.\nLegal and Ethical Considerations This is extremely important: ArgusScan should only be used with proper authorization.\nMandatory Requirements:\nWritten authorization (Rules of Engagement - RoE) before any scanning Only scan systems you own or have explicit permission to test Follow responsible disclosure practices Comply with all applicable laws and regulations Authorized Use Cases:\nBug bounty programs with written authorization Professional pentest engagements with signed RoE Academic security research with proper approvals Defensive security assessments of your own infrastructure Red team exercises with proper authorization Unauthorized Use:\nNever scan systems without permission Never use for malicious purposes Never violate terms of service Never break laws or regulations Security tools are powerful, and with that power comes responsibility. Always use ArgusScan ethically and legally.\nUse Cases ArgusScan is useful in several scenarios:\nAuthorized Bug Bounty Programs: When you have written authorization to test specific targets, ArgusScan helps you find exposed services quickly.\nProfessional Pentest Engagements: Use it during the reconnaissance phase to identify potential targets and attack surfaces before detailed testing.\nAcademic Security Research: Researchers can use it to study internet exposure and security trends, always with proper authorization.\nDefensive Security Assessments: Organizations can use it to assess their own infrastructure and identify misconfigurations or exposed services.\nRed Team Exercises: Red teams can use it to find targets within authorized scope during exercises.\nFuture Roadmap The project is actively maintained, and future enhancements may include:\nSupport for additional export formats Integration with more security tools Enhanced filtering options Web interface for easier use Additional report templates Performance improvements Contributions and feedback are welcome on the GitHub repository.\nConclusion ArgusScan is a powerful tool for ethical security professionals who need to automate reconnaissance during authorized pentest engagements. With its professional CLI, multiple export formats, and high code quality, it’s designed to make security assessments more efficient while maintaining professional standards.\nThe tool demonstrates that open-source security tools can be both powerful and well-built, with comprehensive testing and professional development practices.\nKey Takeaways:\nAutomates Shodan searches for pentest reconnaissance Professional reports following PTES/OWASP standards 96% test coverage and CI/CD pipeline Integrates with popular security tools Always use with proper authorization If you’re a security professional looking to improve your pentest workflow, consider trying ArgusScan.
